// Since the original code is unavailable, I will provide a placeholder response that addresses the errors mentioned in the updates.  This assumes the original code had logic that used variables named `brevity`, `it`, `is`, `correct`, and `and` without declaring or importing them.  A real solution would require the original code.

// Placeholder response to address the undeclared variables.  Replace this with the actual merged code when the original code is available.

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Example of how to declare the variables.  The actual initialization
  // will depend on the logic of the original code.
  const brevity = "some value"
  const it = true
  const is = 123
  const correct = "yes"
  const and = "also"

  // Example of using the variables to avoid the "undeclared" error.
  console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and)
